# <span style="color:blue">Hi there, I'm Ben (he/him) 👋</span>
 - 🔭 I am a sophomore at Yale University planning to major in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

 - 🌱 I have worked as a TA for 4 classes at Yale so far, including [CS50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CS50), Harvard and Yale's on-campus and online introductory computer science course.
 - 💬 I serve as 1 of 6 undergrads on the Yale CS [DSAC](https://zoo.cs.yale.edu/dsac//) to represent Yale’s student body to the CS faculty and administration.
